        <br><h2><b>The Circuit</b></h2>
        <p> For my circuit, I wanted to have a yellow light that flashes at a certain rate. When a button is pushed
            the yellow light should turn off and a blue light should turn on and flash at a faster rate. I knew that
            on each pathway that contained either the button, the blue light, or the yellow light, I'd have to incorporate
            a 1000 Ohm resistor to reduce the current to a safe level that wouldn't damage any of the components. I took
            both inspiration and instruction for this idea from the Arduino Project Book's second project. I knew that both
            my yellow and blue lights would be outputs, so I connected them to a channel and then to ground. For my button,
            since it was the input, it was connected to the 3V channel and then to another channel. 
        </p>

        <br><h2><b>The Code</b></h2>
        <p> Of course the circuit won't work without the code to tell it what to do. Below I've included my code with comments
            explaining the purpose of each line.

        <p>He blinks faster when pressure is applied, kind of like a Harvard student.
