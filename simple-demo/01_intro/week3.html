          <br><h2><b>Designing the Bird</b></h2>
          <p> In creating my flapping bird, I start by making projections of the body, tail, and wings 
              so I could laser cut them out of cardboard. My idea was to have the tail connect to the body 
              like we did with the construction sets. I chose cardboard because I needed the wings to be light 
              so they could be pushed easily by another mechanism and because it was quick and easy to cut
              with the laser cutter. At first I made the slots to connect the tail and body to narrow and later
              fixed the design so they could fit. Here are the projections I used:

          <br><h2><b>Round and Round and Up and Down</b></h2>
          <p> The obvious challenge to creating the bird was going from rotational to vertical motion. After many ideas
              on how to do this and failed attempts, I decided that by attaching a screw to the side of a gear, I could
              loop a piece of brass to make a piston-like structure. I had also constructed a simple box which
              held the bird on a brass pole and would have holes for the two shafts and gears needed to make both wings
              flap. 
          </p>
          <img src = "./rotation.jpg" class = "img-responsive-margin" style = "width:60%" alt = "Image of Projection Sketch">
          <br><p> I knew I needed the wings to just be lightly attached the body so they wouldn't fall to any one side
              so I ended up wrapping thing wire in or around the wings and then looping it around pieces of paperclip 
              stuck in the top of the bird. Since I was running out of time, I had to attach the brass rod from the gears
              to the underside of the wings with just masking tape.  
          </p>
          <img src = "./wingattach.jpg" class = "img-responsive-margin" style = "width:60%" alt = "Image of Cut Piece"><br>
          <p> After much patience, trial and error, and excessive amounts of hot glue, I was able to creat a handcrank 
              that would make both wings rise and fall at the same time.

          <p> It's a bird, it's a plane, it's a PS-70 fever dream!(But also a bird)

          <br><h2><b>Improvements and Future Ideas</b></h2>
          <p> To start with, I would consider remaking the bird and the box with all wood or a sturdier 
              material. I also want to find a way to keep the second gear not attached to the hand crank from
              sliding out of place. I'll be using tubing to act as a washer to see if that leads to any Improvement.
              If I were to do it again, I would also think of a better way of attaching the wings in a cleaner,
              more effective way.
