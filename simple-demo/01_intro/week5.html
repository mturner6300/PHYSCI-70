        <br><h2><b>Design</b></h2>
        <p>In order for my design to not be easily made with subtractive measures, I wanted to add overhangs to it.
            I started by following the lampshade tutorial by fusion desk on youtube: <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PnKBSOulwo&t=335s"></a>
            I created a sketch with the halfway point being an axis and made sure it had a flat top and bottom. I 
            the revolve my sketch to create a 3D body. I used the shell option to hollow out my object.
            From there I projected the body back onto a plane and drew 
            two curves that connected each face. I then extruded the space between these lines and made it intersect with
            the main body. Now I was left with two thin strips which I could place in a circular pattern to create my
            egg like object.

        <br><h2><b>Scanning</b></h2>
        <p> In honor of Polar Bear Day in Pforzheimer House, I wanted to scan my polar bear I got on Housing Day.
            I used the Sense8 to capture the object and I was actually very happy with how it turned out. After
            solidifying the gaps that the sensor missed, I ended up with a really good model.
