        <br><h2><b>Build</b></h2>
        <p>For my project, I wanted to make a simple keyboard and explore the tone function in arduino
            in preparation for my final project idea. I've set up a circuit that uses two 
            capacitive touch sensors to produce three distinct tones when touched. Each one touched
            separately produces a distinct sound and when both are touched, they produce a new sound. 
            Each capacitive touch sensor exists in its own loop and its output decides the input for
            the buzzer in the circuit.
        </p>

        <br><h2>Circuit Schematic</h2>
        <p>Here is the schematic which shows how the circuit was constructed. The box represents the Arduino 
            Metro and the circled numbers inside represent different pins.
        </p>
        <img src = "./Schematic.png" class = "img-responsive-margin" style="width:40%" alt="Image of the circuit">
        <br><h2>Code</h2>
        <p>In the code I define each piece of copper tape as its own capactive touch sensor using commands
            from the capacitivetouch library. 1000 is an abritrary value I chose from guessing and testing. 
            I had to raise the value in the condition where both sensors are pressed because I was decreasing
            the resistance by linking the sensors with my hand. 
        </p>

        <br><h2>In Action</h2>
        <p>Here I've filmed myself demonstrating the circuit's three tone capability with only two sensors.</p>

        <h2>Future Project Concerns and Improvements</h2>
        <p>The fact that the circuit produces the tones I specified tells me that the code works fine. However,
            the circuit is a little unpredictable. I found it making sounds when nothing was pressed or changing
            rapidly between two tones when one was pressed. This could be because of how close I had the sensors
            to each other and to the arduino board. In making my final project, I want to make a clear separation 
            between the components so I know nothing else is affecting the resistance of the touch capacitors.
